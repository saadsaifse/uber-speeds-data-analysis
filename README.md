# Uber Speeds Data Analysis

Ride-hailing has become an increasingly common mode of transportation in every urban city of the world. With the convenience of smartphones, 4G data, and secure payment systems – ride-hailing turns out to be a natural and much needed facility defying all traditional transport mechanisms of the past. 

In 2009,  Uber was launched,  which was the first of its kind company that started offering ride-hailing services in select places of the world. Today Uber is available in 65 countries and over 600 countries worldwide. [Uber completes 14 million trips each day](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/uber-statistics/). Another way of looking at Uber is through a lens of technical capabilities that it has to offer.  Today, it is considered among the top tech companies in the world.  As more and more people use Uber, it gains massive amount of movement and speeds data of the vehicles, that is also publicly available for scientific research and urban planning purposes. One such dataset,  that was released on `May 14th,  2019`,  is the **Movement Speeds** of Uber vehicles recorded around the world.

In this project, Movement Speeds data for Uber rides in `London` city are analyzed. Hourly time series of speeds data is decomposed and predicted during the `1st` quarter of 2018. Furthermore, road accidents (collisions) data from 2018 is read in hope to be correlated with the speeds dataset. 

The objectives of this project are

1. Analyze hourly speed time series to find patterns and relationships.
1. Predict per road future speeds based on the current time-series
1. Analyze and correlate collision data with speeds dataset, to answer questions such as, when did most collisions occur? 

To encourage further development, complete source code and analysis is available in the [src](./src/fullAnalysis.ipynb) directory. This project is open to contributions.
